-----Gusade self learning react note-----

making react app:
- npx create-react-app nama-app
start app :
- npm start

props !important {props.key}
- used to passing variable/data/items/whatever its called from App to component (reusable)

props.children {props.children}
- could be used to make a custom wraper (div), children will be a content inside wraper

passing array from App to component
-> <Component var={arrayName} /> (This is for passing the entire items that available in the array)
-> <Component var1={arrayName[index].content1} var2={arrayName[index].content2} /> (This is for passing one/each or more items that available in the array)
